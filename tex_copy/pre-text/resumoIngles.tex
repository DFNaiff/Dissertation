Most of the important problems in machine learning are computationally expensive, in particular the ones involving Bayesian inference. Many of the current Bayesian techniques requires a large number of likelihood evaluations, which may be infeasible for some cases. In this dissertation, we propose an approximate inference algorithm, based on recent works on variational inference and Gaussian processes. This algorithm, named by the author Boosted Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo, is designed so that few likelihood evaluations are needed. The algorithm, its associated package, and the theory behind it are presented in this work. We also illustrate the algorithm by implementing it in some toy examples, and in a contamination source problem.
