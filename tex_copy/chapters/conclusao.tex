NOTA: ESTOU COM DIFICULDADE PARA ESSA CONCLUSAO.

The method presented in this work, although still immature, has shown promise for use in Bayesian inference, where the likelihood function is expensive of evaluate, that are common in inverse problems.

The associated package, built on top of PyTorch, is accessible and easy of use, and it is made so that a practitioner can quickly employ it in their own problems, if they wish so.
